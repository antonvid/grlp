    <h1>Is representation essential to modern democracy?</h1>
    <div class="author">by: Test author</div>
    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>This essay shall define representation and how it manifests in modern liberal democracy, and the issues which arise from the current democratic system. It will then look at whether representation is an essential component to modern democracy, and bring in an alternative option proposed by Bessette’s deliberative democracy, to which informed debate and force of the better argument is central. These two systems will be compared and contrasted against one another in order to create a nuanced analysis of the essentiality of representation to modern democracy. The levels of reality within each model of democracy will also be discussed, and what shall emerge is that deliberative democracy, whilst works in theory, when conceivably put into practice, will not operate sufficiently on the scale of the modern nation-state. All of this shall assist in creating a clear and concise conclusion that representation is essential to modern democracy.</p>
    <h4>Definitions</h4>
    <p>Modern democracy has developed into several forms, but the most common in the Western world would be considered liberal democracy. Liberal democracy focuses on the individual’s rights, freedoms, a plurality of interests and different perspectives (i.e. individualism). This entails constructions such as the rule of law, separation of powers and a system of checks and balances between branches of government. It is also presumed that there is a multi-party system, with at least two political parties predominantly present, with regular elections in which the people can vote for who they wish to represent them. This can be observed in modern liberal democracies such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America, both of whom have a constitution, the former uncodified and the latter codified.</p>
    <p>Representation is a defining feature of modern democracy, but manifests various fashions. It is the idea that each individual’s interests and opinions are represented in some fashion within a political system. In the UK it would be through factors such as; Trade Unions, Lobbyists, social movements and MPs, each with differing impact and effectiveness. MPs are the primary mode of representation within our political system, as they are ‘regularly’ voted in by electorates in their constituency at general elections. Their job is to represent their constituents in Parliament, voting on and debating laws. There are four models of representation MPs use to represent their constituencies, each with differing implications for the effectiveness of representation. Firstly, the delegate model infers that elected officials are to echo their constituents’ views on subject matters, even if it goes against their own personal views. Secondly, the trustee model, developed by Edmund Burke, states that elected officials should employ the use of their own reason and opinions when making decisions, as they were voted in and therefore trusted to make decisions on behalf of the people. Thirdly, the mandate model states that elected officials should vote in line of their political party’s interests, for example in 2017 Jeremy Corbyn ordered his MPs to vote in favour of triggering Article 50, with most of his MPs voting in the fashion depicted by the mandate model (Stewart, H. and Mason, R. 2017). Finally, there is the descriptive model, which states in order to represent a group, you must be part of that group. This model revolves around shared experience, and is an increasing issue of debate in the current political landscape due to the disproportionately high number of middle-class MPs sitting in Parliament. The existence of elected representatives in modern democracy is known as a representative or ‘indirect’ democracy, and these are the main manifestations of representation which are present for the individual in western democracies.</p>
    <h4>Liberal democracy and deliberative democracy; the role of representation within each</h4>
    <p>When analysing the different models of democracy, the five criteria as posited by Robert Dahl in ‘Democracy and Its Critics’ shall be employed in order to decide the effectiveness of representation; does this model of democracy have: effective participation, voting equality at the decisive stage, enlightened understanding, control of the agenda and the inclusion of all adults (Landemore, H. 2017, pp. 54). </p>
    <p>In Western democracy, it is widely considered we operate under a liberal representative democracy, with elected officials serving as the bridge between us, the people, and political decision making. As discussed above, there are different methods which they can carry out this job, all of which with varying impacts on the effectiveness of representation. However, herein lies the initial problem with representative democracy. Having any sort of mediator (an indirect democracy) between the people and the democratic process immediately dilutes representation in modern democracy. The vast majority of MPs in the UK are guided by their own beliefs and opinions, following the Burkean trustee model. It follows that in our current system, the people have no direct say in what the government does (the exception is in a referendum, of which there have only been three in the history of the UK). Whilst it is possible to lobby your local MP, it is no guarantee that they will act in your interests at all. Furthermore, there is the issue of the scarcity of general elections. This is an issue because the only time which the people have a say in the democratic process is during a general election, which only occurs once every five years. Even then, this is only to elect an official who shall represent their interests for them. It is this form of weak, irregular and indirect representation that plagues our current modern democracy. The impacts of this can be seen in the failures of agenda-setting, effective participation and enlightened understanding (Landemore, H. 2017, pp. 52). Citizens in the UK have no control over the government’s agenda-setting, most noticeably in the governments pro-Israel stance, despite many hundreds-of-thousands opposing this view. Alongside this, there are all time high levels of voter disillusion and apathy, as more and more people fall out of love with democracy, believing they are not represented adequately and that politicians are merely acting for personal gain and will say anything to gain votes. For Landemore (2017, p. 53), this means without a doubt that modern representative democracy is in a serious crisis, especially since she posits that “representation is democracy”. This is reinforced by a YouGov study in 2020 which found that 34% of Britons believed they had no say in how the country was run, and that 26% believed that democracy is working badly (Thiara, A. 2020). This evidence exhibits the fundamental problem of modern democracy; the flawed system of representation. The scarcity of elections and the view that politicians are ‘out of touch’ with the public has fed into voter disillusion and apathy, causing people to lose faith in the system of representation within our modern democracy. A further criticism of modern liberal democracy comes from C. Wright Mills’ ‘The Power Elite’ (1956, pp. 76-77), in which he writes on the domination of the USA political sphere by small circles of elites. These elites are usually big corporations and tech companies, who use their position of power and influence to shape policy decisions in order to further their own ventures. This was noticeably seen in 2021 with Biden’s tax proposals, in which he would reverse Trump’s previously made tax reductions. In response to this, there was a cooperate lobbying campaign working against this, which was funded by and started by big corporations and tech companies who would be hit hardest by this reversal. This is a problem for representation as this creates a tyranny of the minority, as a small bourgeois group’s interests are being represented above the majority, thus hindering representation and the democratic process, which is meant to benefit the majority of people. It is evidential that modern democracy is not currently working as it was intended to, and the main factor contributing to this is representation. The era of big corporations and venture capitalism has fed into a disproportionate system of representation, as those with money have their interests placed above those without. Additionally, modern liberal democracy does not pass any of Dahl’s aforementioned conditions, due to arising issues of inequality and undermined representation. Hence, it can be concluded that representation is essential to modern democracy, as when it is undermined, democracy immediately fails to work for the people.</p>
    <p>Bessette’s deliberative democracy revolves around representation as the linchpin to the system, as it considers “democracy as a means, not an end” (Held, D. 2006, p. 246), showing an emphasis on the process, rather than the outcome. This is because it relies on informed debate, public use of reason and the impartial pursuit of truth from each of its citizens. Through this, it hopes to promote political participation through informed debates and active decision making, during which citizens will be exposed to the force of the better argument (Held, D. 2006, p. 247). This entails that every citizen participating in a debate is able to have their preferences changed when listening to other arguments during the debates. This can only happen if Impartialism is employed, which means entering every debate with an open mind, without any partiality to a particular argument. Held (2006, p.254) writes that the “collective judgements of [deliberative democracy are] arrived at through deliberation guided by impartiality”, reaffirming that this will ensure all points of views are considered during the debate. These central principles to deliberative democracy directly respond to the limitations of modern liberal democracy, in which factors such as informed debates and force of the better argument are lost, with the political landscape being dominated by adversarial party politics. Alongside this, it responds to the limitations of the majoritarian system we have in the UK, which is accentuated by our voting system (first past the post). Our current voting system allows for ‘elected dictatorships’, like Tony Blair’s 179 seat majority in 1997, in which the government can pass most laws (or go to war) without hinderance, or any form of informed debate. This completely removes the process of rational deliberation and debate, as no matter what debate happens, the majoritarian government will always get their way. This directly feeds into voter disillusion and apathy, as there will be a minority group whose voices are not heard, since the majoritarian government does not suitably represent them in this system. This is an area in which deliberative democracy excels. Its focus on rational dialogue which is rooted in public reason and informed debate ensures that an educated consensus can be achieved amongst the population, creating an environment in which democratic representation can be achieved. Deliberative democracy thus ensures an improved quality of democratic decision making, as after an informed and open debate, people will be persuaded by the force of the better argument to create a unanimous judgement. This is reinforced by Habermas’ theory of rational communication (Habermas, J. 1996, p. 32), which refers to the shared capacity of all citizens of a speaking community to reach an intersubjective understanding through reasonable argument and consideration. Habermas argues that in a deliberative democracy, the Ideal Speech Situation (ISS), which posits a model of speech in which communication between participants is unconstrained, free from coercion and undistorted by outside forces such as political powers and ideologies, should be strived for as the normative mode of communication during deliberative debates. Habermas (1996, p. 38) further outlines some conditions that speech acts must fulfil to be considered a valid process. These include factors such as speech being comprehensible, trustful and sincere, and that consensus’s which are achieved are always provisional and can be challenged. From this it can be concluded that in a deliberative democracy, it is the intentions and process which matter the most, rather than the outcome. In theory deliberative democracy wholly solves the limitations of liberal democracy when it comes to sufficient representation and a functioning democracy, especially when it comes to participation, voter disillusion and apathy. However, there are several significant shortfalls of deliberative democracy, which prevent it from being a sufficient model in practice. The first of these is the fact that Impartialism (Held, D. 2006, p. 260) does not entail the view that politics is or can be free of self-interest, it merely puts a restraint on the types of reason we are allowed to employ. There is also no guarantee that a citizen will go into a debate without being motivated by self-interest, as there is no way to check the motivations or interests of a person even after they have employed the theory of communicative rationality. This undermines the credibility of an informed debate, since it is possible to use one’s own self-interest to influence the judgement of a debate. Additionally, there is the further issue of the scale of deliberative democracy. This model is, in theory, a perfectly functioning form of representative democracy. However, this is only when applied to smaller, devolved sections of decision making in modern democracy. Landemore (2017, p.52) outlines that direct deliberation among all citizens is widely assumed to be impossible on the scale of the modern nation-state, due to the vast number of citizens and the immense diversity of views. It is simply not possible for every single citizen of a modern state to assemble and proactively participate in an informed debate in order to arrive at a collective political decision. Whilst deliberative democracy can be applied to areas of decision making, such as local government and citizens assemblies, it is simply not enough for the scale of modern democracy. So, whilst it places a great emphasis on representation and participation, it is not a system which would functionally represent citizens in modern democracy. On the other hand, deliberative democracy passes Dahl’s conditions for an effective democracy, due to the high levels or representation and enlightened understanding which is produced from this democratic system. Furthermore, it solves core issues surrounding liberal representative democracy, such as the ‘Tinkerbell Effect’ and ‘confirmation bias’. The Tinkerbell Effect is used to describe when voters do not vote a certain way because they believe that the party or politician they want to vote for has no chance of winning, and instead votes for another who is more likely to win, even if they do not represent them as they would wish. This is an issue for modern democracy as it undermines representation, due to the fact people believe they are being prevented from voting for their desired candidate. Deliberative democracy solves this, as during rational debate there is to be no distortion of irrational influences such as this. Confirmation bias refers to when people select certain information which supports their views, whilst ignoring contrary information. This is most common when one has a desired outcome, so selectively chooses information to support this. This is most commonly seen in modern democracy on social media. In 2016 during the Brexit campaign, typically Conservative voters were selectively targeted on social media with ads supporting their views to leave the EU. These ads typically employed misinformation (especially on Facebook), such as stating that Turkey would be joining the EU, and thousands of migrants would be pouring into the UK unless we left. This is an issue because it merely tells people what they wish to hear, even if it is misinformation. This hinders modern democracy as the representation is based upon reason, and if this reason is based upon falsities, then it ceases to become useful in an informed debate. This issue also feeds into adversarial politics, where semantics and misinformation is wielded as a tool of persuasion, rather than a structured and informed debate. Deliberative democracy solves this issue with the ISS, as speech is to be free from lies and insincerity. It can be evaluated that deliberative democracy is an ideal form of democracy in theory, but in practice it would simply not work on the scale of the modern nation-state. From this, it can be concluded that representation is necessary to modern democracy, as in democratic systems which revolve around complete representation, the functionality and participation in the democratic process increase.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>In conclusion, representation is completely necessary to modern democracy, as without it we lose the people to apathy and disillusionment, which is a wholly dangerous path for democracy to wonder. The moment the state loses the support and action of the people is the moment the state fails to provide an adequate democratic political system. Whilst it is evidentially clear that modern liberal democracy is failing, this only highlights the essentiality of representation in modern democracy. When compared to deliberative democracy, the alternative possibility of what the modern democratic process could and should be about is placed under the spotlight. A focus on representation of the individual on a wide scale, where equality and informed debate is the focal point, is what is needed in order to create a fair and equal society. The current state of liberal democracy where adversarial party politics is at the centre is simply not working, as it divides the people and creates an environment in which proper representation is not possible, since representatives are more concerned with the party’s interest rather than their constituents.</p>
    <p>Following this, through this observing the discourse in representation and the evaluation of the functionality of liberal and deliberative democracy, it remains constant and observable that representation is essential for modern democracy to operate, as well as keep people enchanted with the idea of the state. It is the lack of representation in modern democracy which feeds into voter disillusion and apathy, which deliberative democracy does well to overcome. Whilst it will not work in practice, it still serves its purpose as maintaining that representation should be, and needs to be, at the forefront of any form of democracy in order for it to function in a fashion which serves the people. Therefore, it is concluded that representation is essential to modern democracy.</p>
